## Summary

Snake Game! Is a virtual game where the goal is to eat as many apples and grow your snake as long as possible. Using the direction arrow keys, direct the snake up, down, left, and right across the gameboard (but not backwards!) to hunt for delicious apples to eat. Every time the snake eats an apple, its body grows by one link!

The game ends when you collide with a wall or the snake accidentally "eats" itself. Score resets after each round, what will your high score be?

Through developing this game I learned how to modulate similar functions in code to make it more readable and easier to edit in the future. Learning how to utilize a gameboard was a fun challenge that really played into the logic behind code that I enjoy so much.
